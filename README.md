# Shortest-Common-Superstring

The Shortest Common Superstring problem is defined as follows: 

fffff

We implement a greedy procedure and design a boosting subroutine for the greedy procedure to improve the quality of the solution of the greedy procedure for the shortest common superstring problem.
## Running the code
Run the main.py file to run the greedy procedure and the boosting procedure in the greedy algorithm.
## Notes
The programs only run in python 2.X and might throw errors in other versions.
